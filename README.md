### Take home assignments
*The take home assignment: Analyze data set X and create a presentation of your findings*  

This is a common task that seems easy on teh face of it but is actually very difficulyt. Ther are two main dangers: 1. Since there are very few parameters you may go in a direction that is not what the interviewers are looking for. 2. If you are given an ambiguous task you may want to clarify things. This can either be interpretted as good (showing initiative) or bad (not being independent). If you do get a task like this, have someone else read it if possible and interpret it without you telling them what you think it is about. That way you will at least bet some feedback on what a common interpretation is. These types of assignments are good for graduate students as they are used to the format from doing homework and generally have more time to spend on them than people who are working already.  

### Screening questions
